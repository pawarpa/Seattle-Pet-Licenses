# SQL Analysis and Visualization: Seattle Pet Licenses

## Overview: 
This repository contains the code and documentation for my academic project, where I conducted SQL analysis and visualization of the Seattle Pet Licenses dataset. The project aimed to explore and derive meaningful insights from the dataset using tools such as **Alteryx** for data preparation and profiling, **Tableau** for data visualization, and **MySQL** for database management.

## About the dataset:
The dataset used is Seattle Pet Licenses, which is provided by the City of Seattle. This dataset is a reflection of Seattle's commitment to responsible pet ownership and community welfare. Its a comprehensive collection of information that provides valuable insights into the city's pet population.

It contains a list of active or current Seattle pet licenses from October 2015 to April 2023, including animal type (species), pet's name, breed, and the owner's ZIP code.

## Project Motivation and Goal:
In an effort to enhance public safety, promote animal welfare, and maintain a healthy environment, the City of Seattle requires pet owners to obtain licenses for their furry companions. By analyzing the Seattle Pet Licenses dataset, researchers, policymakers, and the general public can gain a deeper understanding of the distribution and demographics of pets within the city. This information is instrumental in shaping policies, implementing targeted outreach programs, and fostering a sense of community responsibility towards our four-legged friends.

Whether you're interested in tracking trends in pet ownership, analyzing the prevalence of specific breeds, or understanding the geographical distribution of licensed pets, this project serves as a valuable resource. It is a testament to Seattle's proactive approach to fostering a harmonious coexistence between residents and their beloved pets. From the bustling urban areas to the serene neighborhoods, each data point contributes to a broader narrative of responsible pet ownership and the shared bond between Seattleites and their animal companions. 

**Let's delve into the Seattle Pet Licenses dataset to discover the stories it tells about the city's vibrant and diverse pet community.**
